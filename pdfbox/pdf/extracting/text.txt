ASCII (/?æski/ ASS-kee), abbreviated from American Standard Code for 
Information Interchange,[1] is acharacter-encoding scheme. Originally based on 
the English alphabet, it encodes 128 specified charactersinto 7-bit binary integers 
as shown by the ASCII chart on the right.[2] The characters encoded 
are numbers0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, 
basic punctuation symbols, control codes that originated with Teletype machines, 
and space. For example, lowercase j would become binary 1101010 
and decimal 106. 
ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other 
devices that use text. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on 
ASCII, though they support many additional characters. 
ASCII developed from telegraphic codes. Its first commercial use was as a 7-
bit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services. Work on the ASCII standard 
began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of theAmerican Standards 
Association's (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was 
published during 1963,[3][4] a major revision during 1967,[5] and the most recent 
update during 1986.[6] Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell 
code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., 
alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters. 
ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing control 
characters (many now obsolete)[7] that affect how text and space are 
processed[8]and 95 printable characters, including the space (which is considered 
an invisible graphic[9][10]). 
The IANA prefers the name US-ASCII.[11] ASCII was the most common character 
encoding on the World Wide Web until December 2007, when it was surpassed 
by UTF-8, which includes ASCII as a subset.[12][13][14]
